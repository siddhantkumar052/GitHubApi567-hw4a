Summary: 
To make the program easier, the program would be implemented over a period of time ( Including the tests), since githubAPI limits number of calls. To sya within the limit, it would have been better to implement it gradually. One thing that would have made program easier was to cache the data using some technology like Redis so that the cashed data can be used further to process data, this way we can limit api calls and save the number of calls for actual testing.
I personally faced the challenge of running out of Api calls multiple times while trying to execute the prorgam.
